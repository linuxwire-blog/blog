<p>Hello world! My name is Celestia and I am a 19 year-old mathematics and theoretical computer science student in Florida, also known as Hadestown... Despite having a two-year college background in liberal-arts education, when I was 18 and first entered university post-highschool, I found a love for math that I never expected to have.</p>

<p>
I have strong interests in fields from electrical engineering, to history, to mathematics (of course), and programming. I hope I can use this blog as an outlet for all of my (admittedly) hyperfixations as well as document my experience of being a queer student in a place that is overall relativly hostile to my existence. </p>

<p>I am currently active in research in both mathematics and in interdisciplinary engineering fields, and I frequently attend conferences and give talks. Maybe I will get to see you at one. 
</p>
